DeviceCleanupCmd V1.2.2 - removes non present Devices from the device tree
Freeware by Uwe Sieber (c) 2007-2024

Commandline tool which removes non present devices from the device tree
which match one of the given patterns.


Works under Window 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8, 10, 11 and their Server versions

Under x64 edtitions of Windows only the x64 version can remove devices.



Usage:

DeviceCleanupCmd pattern1 [pattern2] [patternN] [-e:excludepattern1] [-t] [-s] [-m:min-age] [-v] [-n]

-e:excludepattern  pattern not to remove (one -e:xxx for each)
-t  test only
-s  skip creation of a system restore point
-m  minimum age of devices to remove
-v  verbose mode
-n  no wait for key press when finished

patterns are device IDs, device classes or friendly names. Wildcards can be used.

Samples:

remove all non present devices whose device IDs begin with HID\VID_045E
DeviceCleanupCmd HID\VID_045E*

remove all non present devices whose device IDs contain VID_045E&PID_1234
DeviceCleanupCmd "*VID_045E&PID_1234*"
(Because of the contained & character the ID must be enclosed in quotation marks.)

remove all bluetooth devices but not COM9 and COM10
DeviceCleanupCmd BTH* -e:"* (COM9)" -e:"* (COM10)"
(Because of the contained space character the string must be enclosed in quotation marks.)

remove all non present devices whose device class is Media
DeviceCleanupCmd Media

remove all non present devices
DeviceCleanupCmd *

remove all non present devices not used for at least one year
DeviceCleanupCmd * -m:1y

Units are y - year, m - month, d - days, h - hours, i - minutes, s - seconds

Test mode (shows which devices would be removed)
DeviceCleanupCmd * -t


The device's 'age' time comes from the write time of the device's registry key
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum

On some Windows the times are set on startup or recurring for no obvious reason,
so all devices seem to have the same age. On most Windows the time is set when
the device gets active.

Non-PnP devices and 'soft' devices are not deleted because they are not automatically
re-installed. These are devices whose ID begins with
- HTREE\ROOT\
- ROOT\
- SWD\
- SW\{

If you want to delete them, use a pattern that begins with one of these strings.
Or use the GUI version of DeviceCleanup.

By default a System Restore Point is created before the first device is removed
(provided Windows has a System Restore).
Since Windows 8 only one SRP within 24 hours can be created. For any further the API
pretends to have created one but did nothing in fact.
This can be overruled by setting the registry value SystemRestorePointCreationFrequency under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore to a minimal
allowed interval in minutes, 0 disables the blocking completely.
When creating a System Restore Point, DeviceCleanup sets this value to 0 temporarily.


If the last device using a certain COM-port is removed then the reservation under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\COM Name Arbiter
is removed.
Since Windows 10 version 1903 there is a sub-key "Devices" where Windows tries to keeps track of
COM-ports and their devices. Windows uses this to remove the reservation when a COM-port device
is uninstalled. Finally after 25 years. Of course Windows does not check for other devices
which use the same COM port. DeviceCleanup does.



Administrator privileges are required for cleanup.

A GUI version is available too:
